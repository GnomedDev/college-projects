# College Projects
Repository for projects I am working on at college, currently doing a T-Level in Software Development.

Most (if not all) of these projects will be Python due to requirements of the course.

## Projects

- Vending - A TUI Vending machine simulation requiring `tabulate` from `pip` using sqlite to store stock and products.

- Connect4 - A two player TUI Connect 4 copy with customisable board size.
